<h4 class= "has-text-white" style="font-size:40px;">Web Check-In</h4>

<p class="has-text-white">In our first week working on the project, we outlined a plan in order to accomplish all of the major 
  parts of the project. The plan is outlined below.</p>
  
<p class="has-text-white">The plan was to implement the final design through four major steps. Step one was creating the C code that would
  give an output from the board input. This means as the accelerometer value changed, the board would take that input
  and put out an output. We also added a light toggle when the output is sent out to show that the board was working
  properly and correctly reading the motion direction. Step two was creating a Python GUI that set up the Breakout
  screen. For testing, we mapped the controls to the keys on the keyboard. Step three was creating serial outputs
  tied to the board that could then be attached to the Breakout game. Finally, step four was changing the game so 
  the paddle movements were attached to the board.</p>
  
 <p class="has-text-white">Addendum: We have taken out the accelerometer implementation from this project due to time constraints. Instead,
  the game controls are mapped to the board in such a way that the SW1 and SW3 keys toggle them via UART0.</p>


<h2 class = "has-text-white"style="font-size:40px;">Introduction</h2>
<p class="has-text-white">Atari Breakout is a video game released for the first time in 1976. Created by Steve Jobs, Breakout was considered 
  revolutionary for its use of multiple layers of bricks, its smooth functionality, and its first of a kind use of
  the atari joystick. While many of the mechanics mimicked Atari Pong, Breakout became a significantly larger culture 
  phenomenon that sparked hundreds of clones, with one clone even being a packed in file for the first generation
  Apple Macintosh Home Computer.</p>
  
<p class="has-text-white"> In Breakout, the player uses a controller to move a paddle back and forth horizontally across the screen. The 
  goal is to place the paddle so that a circular ball bounces off of the paddle. The ball will collide with multi-colored
  bricks abover the board, and when the ball hits the brick the brick will dissappear based on a predetermined "health"
  of the brick (A.K.A the number of hits from the ball the brick can withstand). The goal of the game is to clear
  all of the bricks from the game space, and if you can complete a "clean sweep" the player will move onto to a more
  difficult level where there are more bricks in the space and the bricks have a greater "health."</p>
  
<p class="has-text-white">Breakout has for nearly 50 years captivated audiences around the world, and is one of the best selling games of 
    all time. It also was the game that put Steve Jobs, the head developer, on the map. Without Breakout, the Atari 
    would never have become as popular, and it can be speculated that Apple may have never started if it wasn't for 
    the personal profits Job's saw from Breakout and its groundbreaking sales numbers.</p>
  
<p class="has-text-white"> During this project, our group learned about game design and some of the difficulties developers have. In particular
  we learned about developing a GUI for the game, how to create a controller from our FRDMKL46Z, and what parameters of 
  the game we needed to change in order to make the product more playable and enjoyable using our controller.

<h2 class = "has-text-white" style="font-size:40px;">System Overview and diagram</h2>
<p class="has-text-white">Our System is initialized in both Python and MCUxpresso. The C code is run first, and connects the COMM port to the board.
    The C code works by detecting an input into the left and or right button, and will toggle, respectively, the red and green
    light. The code also sends out through the COMM port a r or an l. The python GUI is in an infinite while loop, and is waiting
    for both the left and the right button to be pressed in order to start the game. Once the game starts, the python GUI is 
    waiting for either an r or an l, and when that appears from the port it will move the game paddle to either the left or 
  the right. </p>

<h2 class = "has-text-white" style="font-size:40px;">Technical description</h2>
<p class="has-text-white">As we explain throughout our video, the process of first recieving and reading the SW1 and SW3 button clicks and using LEDs to signal button pressing. We used 
this testing method to ensure buttons were mapped correctly to a function, and implemented these buttons to serve as movement keys in our atari breakout game. We included additional functionality
will double pressing keys to start the game, as well as a updating score board with a highest score feature. </p>
      
<h2 class = "has-text-white" style="font-size:40px;">Testing</h2>
<p class="has-text-white">In order to test the board, the group attempted a variety of different commands on the board and watched how the serial reacted. 
  This included pressing both buttons at the same time, holding one button, holding both buttons, pressing one button as fast 
  as possible, and pressing each back and forth. By watching the serial we were able to also test how the paddle would react 
  in the GUI.</p>

<h2 class = "has-text-white" style="font-size:40px;">Work Distribution</h2>
<p class ="has-text-white">Luke, Abdul, and Chris broke up the work evenly. Luke created the Python GUI and did the majority of the writing of the website.
  Abdul did some of the website and wrote the initial control software that allowed the buttons to function as well as toggle
  the red and green lights. Abdul also helped with the website. Chris took Abdul's code and Luke's code and integrated them with
  serial code that allowed the board to communicate with the Python GUI through the UART0 virtual serial port. He also worked on
  the technical description and testing parts of the website. The group met multiple times to test the project, and create the video,
  and each member went over all of the code the other members wrote.</p>
